"""VERY HARD - IRC logs as CSV

First, download or clone the francejs git repository.
https://github.com/francejs/irc-bot
Then, concatenate all logs files in the logs folder into a single francejs.csv
file. Just for your information, this file should contain more than 36,000 lines.

You'll write a program parsing this file (using the csv Python module), to find
out and print which pair of nicknames mention each other the most, like:

$ python3 solution.py
mdk, sizeof

Beware, I may test with another dataset (of the exact same format).
Data format of this csv file

There's 4 columns:
- Message type (1 means it's a message, other values means it's a system info, we ignore them)
- Timestamp of the message (number of seconds since 1st jan 1970 UTC)
- Username involved
- Actual message

For example, this line has no interest, it simply logs the arrival of a user,
notice the 2 in the fist column, meaning it's a system info, not a text message:

2,1382426750452,"_mlb","_mlb join the chan."

Here, user _kud mentions user nfroidure on the third line, that's what we're searching for:

1,1382442768956,"nfroidure","pour effroi, je pr√©cise"
1,1382442902196,"fbentz","o/"
1,1382443055876,"_kud","On devrait sponsoriser effroi par morsay, nfroidure"
